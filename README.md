**Agitation** is an e-commerce framework, based on Symfony2, focussed on extendability through plugged-in APIs, UIs, payment modules and other components.

## agitation/profile-bundle

This bundle allows users to access pages requiring authentication (HTTP 401). First, it will display a login form instead of the page content. After credentials have been submitted, the page will reload and show the actual content.

Furthermore, this bundle gives users tools for profile self-service, such as password reset and account modification.
